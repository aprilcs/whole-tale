# Open Science Infrastructure Working Group

Status: Proposed

## Members
* Craig Willis (NCSA/WT)
* Kacper Kowalik (NCSA/WT)

# Description
The proposed working group will bring together representatives from key open science infrastructure projects related to computational reproducibility and publishing of composite research objects (e.g., code, data, and environment) to improve interoperability and to coordinate collaborative development as needed. A central goal of the project is to maximize the utility of developed tools while minimizing duplication of effort. The working group may also expand to cover technical approaches to tracking provenance.
