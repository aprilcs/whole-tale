# Working Groups

Working Groups for the Whole Tale project are necessary to increase engagement with communities of researchers who may either use Whole Tale or who may have expertise in areas relevant to Whole Tale design and implementation.

## Extant Working Groups

 * Education and Training (none)
 * Materials Science (Kyle Chard)
 * Astrophysics (Matthew Turk)
 * Earth and Environmental Sciences (none)
 * Social Sciences (Jarek Nabrzyski)
 * Bioinformatics and Genomics (none)
 * Tool Development (Kyle Chard)
 * Reproducibility (Victoria Stodden)
 * Information Sciences (Bertram Ludaescher)
 
## Working Group Charge

The working groups span multiple domains, as well as multiple areas of input for the Whole Tale project.  Some (such as reproducibility) address both policy and technical decisions; others (such as astrophysics) are less related to policy decisions and more focused on identify needs and evaluating solutions to increase uptake.

We have broken the means of interaction into two broad categories -- input that is meant to guide or steer, and feedback on developed components.

### Input for Executive Team and Developers

 * Design
 * Implementation
 * Policy decisions
 * Engagement

### Feedback and Usage of Components

 * Utilize
 * Advocate
 
## Working Group Infrastructure

Several pieces of infrastructure are necessary to ensure that working group functioning is transparent and accessible.

 * Mailing list: A principle mailing list for communication.  At present, the naming convention we have utilized for other WT activity has been to prefix with `wt-`.  For working groups, we recommend creating a *public* mailing list of the form `wt-WGNAME-wg` (with the prefix `wt` and suffix `wg`) on Google Groups.  Working group mailing lists should be public.
 * Meeting notes: Meeting notes should be in markdown format and checked into the github repository `whole-tale/whole-tale`
 * Slack: Working group members will be invited to the slack team and to a working group channel within that team.
 
Google Docs are used for internal discussions and document development within the Whole Tale project.  This is not sufficient for outward-facing documents such as those produced by working groups, which need to be included among project documents such as those in the `wt-design-docs` repository.  If notes are taken during a meeting in a Google Doc, they should be converted to markdown and placed into the github repository at the meeting's conclusion.  Alternately, for a real-time collaborative environment, [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io) can be used for note-taking in markdown.

## Template Email

We have a template [email](./onboarding.md) to use for welcoming folks.
