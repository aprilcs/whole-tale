Dear all,

Thank you for participating in the (your working group name here) working group for the Whole Tale project.  We are excited about the Whole Tale, and grateful you are willing to spend your time, energy and thoughts on participating in this endeavor.

The formal charge for the working groups involved with Whole Tale is three-fold.  The first is to provide input regarding decisions that need to be made with respect to technical directions or policy decisions with Whole Tale. The second is to provide feedback on the implementations of technologies and policies in the Whole Tale project.  Finally, we would ask that the Working Group members utilize the Whole Tale and, when comfortable doing so, evangelize it to their colleagues and collaborators.  Building a critical mass of research being conducted in Whole Tale will help to build momentum and ensure its applicability, and we hope to partner with working group members to do so.

We expect that meetings of the working groups will occur roughly quarterly.  Notes from these meetings will be made public, as will the membership, and the working groups will communicate through an executive team liasion to both provide feedback and receive particular questions and inquiries.  Members will have access to a mailing list for discussions and will be invited to the Whole Tale slack team, which they're encouraged to use to chat with other working group members and the other project team members.

Thanks again for your engagement, and we look forward to working with you!

(your name here)
