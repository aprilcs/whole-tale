## Description
The Information Science WG brings together information scientists and research data librarians to evaluate engagement with the participating scientific communities. This includes mapping pre-existing research practices within participating scientific communities to better understand scientistsâ€™ personal workflows and evaluating the effectiveness of the developed tools to meet researcher needs. A key first step is the development of researcher personas to inform system development.
